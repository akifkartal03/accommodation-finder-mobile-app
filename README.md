### Brief Description

- In this mobile application, GTU students can find a place such as public or private dormitory around the university to stay and chat with other students to find a housemate.
- In this project, I also tried to determine whether a dormitory comment is positive or negative. In order to do this, I have used some Natural Language Processing methods in my sentiment analysis module.
